# Project Paper

This project is a work in progress. The secondary intent behind it is to explore pages on github, as well as css, javascript 
and how to develop with them.  The primary intent for this project is to develop a small simulation based upon
the behavior of ants.

## Ant Simulator Goals
* simulate ants and how they might track pheremones
* using multiple path finding algorithms for an ant in different circumstances.
    * Ant follows food scent to food
    * pheremone bleeds into adjacent cells?
    * Ant will lay down pheremone when it discovers food source
    * Ant will follow homing trail if it has food.
* Extrapolate this to many ants and see whether ant trails converge.
